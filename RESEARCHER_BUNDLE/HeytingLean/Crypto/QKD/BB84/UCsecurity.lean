# BB84 UC-style security (interface-first, reduction-based)

We avoid a full UC framework proof. Instead we provide a **reduction principle**:
if any successful distinguishing attack against BB84 (real vs ideal) would imply
the CT-forbidden subtask `copyAll` is possible, then BB84 is UC-secure.

This matches the bundle's "no global axioms" policy: the reduction hypothesis is
packaged as a structure field, not asserted globally.
